/**
 * @POS -> Validator,,more scalability,,energy efficient,,node has been locked,,,more scalable
 * Finds only one block who will work as a validator and for this purpose cryptocurrencies are needed
 * the node is being choosen randomly or the richest one owns it
 * 
 * @POW -> Miners,,,lesser scalable
 * out of the whole part only a smaller part is choosen to initiate the transaction and within that zone
 * all other nodes compete with each other...algo used for Complex Mathematical Puzzle(to find out
 * which part will be choosen)
 * 
 * @CONCENSUS -> Agreement of all validators...
 * valid or not
 * malicious behaviour or attacks or hacking
 * secure,reliable
 * 
 * @How_Miners_Pick_Transactions
 * ----------------------------------
 * 1.Transaction Fee (more ? select : not select)
 * 2.if someone send 100 MillionHashing/sec (MH/Sec) within fraction of seconds then for the remaining
 * time they pick the more prior transaction fee , replace it with the latest one and keeps on until the
 * timestamp is being over...so computer doesn't remain idle...
 * 
 * @HARD_FORK -> Change/Upgrade
 * correcting security risk
 * coding functionality
 * reverse transaction
 * adding new rule to code
 * 
 * @SOFT_FORK -> Backend Compatible
 * Addition of new rule doesn't clash with older rule...
 * subset of older rule
 * Longest Chain Rule is being followed
 * 
 * @AIRDROP -> in Apple...sharing data from one to another
 * Marketing Strategy
 * Cake Example...
